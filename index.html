        <h4>Why this course?</h4>
        <p>As i have mentioned in my education that i have already studied frontend development and now i want to dig deep into backend because I'm really interested in how websites works behind the scenes. This course will teach me all about the important stuff that happens on backend, like managing data and writing code that makes everything run smoothly.
            I believe this course will give me the skills i need to create a full website with frontend and backend functioning. Moreover, learning about backend development is important because its in high demand in the tech industry right now. Studying this course will help me grow as a developer and achieve my career goals.
